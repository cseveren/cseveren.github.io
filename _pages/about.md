I am an Economic Advisor and Economist in the Research Department of the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/). My research spans urban, environmental, and development economics. I completed my PhD in 2017 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by faculty in both the [Department of Economics](https://econ.ucsb.edu/) and the [Bren School](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/). While I was in Santa Barbara, I [raced](https://cseveren.github.io/files/18673170_10212419321132629_776692333297586652_o.jpg) [wa'a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrigger_boat).

Before graduate school, I worked for an energy efficiency consulting firm in Austin, TX. During my undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where I majored in Latin American Studies ([LLILAS](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/llilas/)) and Economics, I produced documentaries about social issues in Thailand and Paraguay. Once upon a time, I spent two years at UNT in Denton, TX, thinking I wanted to study music. Before that, I delivered pizza and gassed up boats.

### New Developments
* Jun '24 - Updated draft with [Valerie Bostwick](https://vkbostwick.weebly.com/) on [driving restrictions and teen school and work outcomes](https://cseveren.github.io/files/driving_dropouts_draft.pdf)
* May '23 - What started as an interdisciplinary chat turned into a paper and is now out at Nature Communications (with Laura Dee and Paul Ferraro)! This long-running project applies causal econometric techniques to the analysis of [biodiversity and (grassland) productivity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37194-5).
* Mar '23 - New Brookings post about whether currents trends in vehicle usage represent a [change in preferences](https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-are-young-people-driving-less-evidence-points-to-economics-not-preferences/) (the answer: no, at least not yet).
* Jan '23 - Our paper on [racialized differences in commuting outcomes in the US since 1980](https://cseveren.github.io/files/racialized_difference_commuting_Final.pdf) has been accepted at JUE! This final version addresses market access, selection, and housing capitalization of commute times.
