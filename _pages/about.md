I am a Ph.D candidate in Economics at Claremont Graduate University (CGU) and a member of the [Computational Justice Lab](https://www.http://computationaljusticelab.org/). My primary research interest is applied microeconomics; however, my other interests include causal inference and applications of machine learning methods for causal inference.

I have been working as a Data Research Intern at 211 LA for the last two years. I have been building recommendation systems
for 211 dispatchers by using Deep Learning and Machine Learning models in Pytorch and Sklearn(Python). I have been involved in the project of evaluating recommender bot by A/B testing techniques.
