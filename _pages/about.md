## Welcome!

I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar in Health Economics** at the University of California, Irvine’s *Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health*.  
My research examines how **health and labor policies** shape access to care, health behaviors, and economic well-being.  
Using **quasi-experimental methods** and large administrative and survey datasets, I study topics including **Medicaid dental benefits and birth outcomes**, **hearing aid coverage mandates**, **paid sick leave policies**, and **telehealth expansion**.  
Across these projects, my work aims to generate evidence that informs **equitable and cost-effective public policy**.
